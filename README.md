Develop an api that moves a rover around on a grid.
You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
The rover receives a character array of commands.
Implement commands that move the rover forward/backward (f,b).
Implement commands that turn the rover left/right (l,r).
Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another. (planets are spheres after all).
Example: The rover is on a 100x100 grid at location (0, 0) and facing NORTH. The rover is given the commands "ffrff" and should end up at (2, 2).
